# Github.io Starter Portfolio Page
The first iteration of this repo I started in bootcamp while learning concepts in HTML/CSS/JS. It's really dope to see how your skills improve over time, so I wanted to add to this repo with something that would be useful for beginners to use and grow into the portfolio site of their dreams. â™¥

## Submitting a Pull Request
Submitting a pull request is welcomed! I'm going to leave this as a small personal portfolio, but I left a few places to be edited or cleaned up, especially on the `style.css` file. 

Try your hand at submitting a pull request with changes to the CSS, and I'll integrate it. It's great practice to contribute to open source projects and something that helped me when I learned.

## Pay It Forward 
Once you've progressed in your knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, share this repo with a friend and have them create their own github.io portfolio page! Make it a practice to share what you've learned- the developer community will thank you for it!
